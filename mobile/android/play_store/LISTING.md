### Main Description (Version 1 - Conversational)

**Transform Your Relationship with Your Phone**

Meet FocusMother - not just another screen time tracker, but your personal AI-powered digital guardian who actually talks to you. Instead of harsh limits and blocked apps, FocusMother uses empathetic conversation to help you build healthier phone habits.

**🤖 Meet Your AI Guardian**
• Create a personalized 3D avatar from your selfie
• Powered by advanced AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
• Conversations tailored to your usage patterns
• Non-judgmental, supportive coaching style

**💬 Negotiate, Don't Dictate**
Unlike traditional screen time apps that force restrictions, FocusMother opens a dialogue:
• AI detects excessive usage and starts a conversation
• Discuss why you need more time on that app
• Negotiate reasonable time limits together
• Agreements are enforced, but you're always in control

**📊 Smart Usage Monitoring**
• Monitors 300+ categorized apps (social media, games, entertainment)
• Detects patterns of excessive screen time
• Privacy-first: all data stays on your device
• No tracking, no selling your data

**✨ Key Features**
• **AI Conversations**: Chat with your digital guardian when you're overusing apps
• **Time Agreements**: Negotiate specific time limits for different apps
• **3D Avatar**: Personalized companion created from your photo
• **App Categories**: Automatic categorization of social media, games, productivity apps
• **Usage Analytics**: Track your progress and see weekly trends
• **Quiet Hours**: No interruptions during sleep or important times
• **Privacy First**: Local storage, encrypted data, no cloud sync required

**🎯 How It Works**
1. **Monitor**: FocusMother watches your app usage in the background
2. **Detect**: When you spend too much time on distracting apps, your AI guardian notices
3. **Converse**: A full-screen conversation opens - your avatar asks about your intentions
4. **Negotiate**: Discuss and agree on a reasonable time limit (e.g., "5 more minutes")
5. **Enforce**: FocusMother reminds you when time is up
6. **Succeed**: Build better habits through respectful accountability
